# Python-libs
some nice python libraries I made. Use them to make your life easier :)

FolderUtils:
    I made this to make writing to files easier. Gives simple access to writing,
    removing and creating files. Also allows you to create and remove directories.
    Can be installed using: pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ FolderUtils-applegod==0.0.1
    I'll upload it to the main pypi servers when every package is built.


    requirements:  
    -os     (default)
    -shutil (default)

calc:
    I made this to add most math functions you'd find on a calculator to python.
    This is surprisingly hard, so will take a while to finish.
    can be installed using: pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ calc-applegod==0.0.1
    I'll soon upload it to the main pypi servers. The package name is also calc_applegod to
    avoid any collision with other packages

    requirements:
    -random (default)


throw:
    I made this to add error codes to python if you want to forcequit a python program.
    Very simple, doesn't need to be a library, but I still felt like making it. It made it
    feel a bit cleaner and stuff

    no requirements

only calc is built yet. And not even uploaded to the main pypi servers.
If you want to use any of these files, paste them into the same directory you have your python files,
(or just run the commands i added to every package i built and uploaded)
and then at the beginning of your file, just do "import <python-lib>" make sure to leave the .py 
extension out of the import statement
