# Python-libs
some nice python libraries I made. Use them to make your life easier :)

FileUtils:
    I made this to make writing to files easier. Gives simple access to writing,
    removing and creating files. Also allows you to create and remove directories

calc:
    I made this to add most math functions you'd find on a calculator to python.
    This is surprisingly hard, so will take a while

throw:
    I made this to add error codes to python if you want to forcequit a python program.
    Very simple, doesn't need to be a library, but I still felt like making it. It made it
    feel a bit cleaner and stuff

None of this is built yet. I'm still figuring that out.
If you want to use any of these files, paste them into the same directory you have your python files,
and then at the beginning of your file, just do "import <python-lib>" make sure to leave the .py 
extension out of the import statement
